-   Create a data frame comprised of:
    -   random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
    -   logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
        greater than 0
    -   a character vector of length 10
    -   factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
