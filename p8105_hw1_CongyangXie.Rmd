# Problem 1

* Create a data frame comprised of:
  + random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
  + logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
  + a character vector of length 10
  + factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

df1 <- data.frame(c1 = rnorm(10), 
                  c2 = is.positive(c1), 
                  c3 = rep_len('ImAChar', 10), 
                  c4 = factor(sample(c("Lv1","Lv2","Lv3"), 10, replace = TRUE), 
                              ordered = TRUE, 
                              levels = c("Lv1","Lv2","Lv3")))
```
